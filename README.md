# mp4togif

A full copy of the sources of [mp4togif.com](https://www.mp4togif.com). mp4togif.com is a webapp to convert different video-formats to gif or webm files. Also you can add image-effects and animation-effects. Based on the [cJS-Framework](https://github.com/annonyme/cjsv2).

I have not enough time to improve this webapp anymore, so everyone is free to fork this project, improve it and use it on your own homepage. Have fun!
